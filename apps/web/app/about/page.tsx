            The trust layer regulated AI was missing.
          </h1>

          <p className="lede" style={{ marginTop: "24px" }}>
            Enterprises are adopting AI faster than they can govern it. Analysts paste customer data
            into chatbots, agents take actions no one reviewed, and when a regulator asks "show me
            this control worked," there's nothing to hand over.
          </p>

          <p className="drop-cap" style={{ marginTop: "28px", fontSize: "1.02rem", lineHeight: 1.8, color: "var(--ink-soft)" }}>
            Vaultex exists to close that gap. We build the trust layer between an enterprise and the
            LLMs it uses — governing what goes in, watching what comes out, and keeping the immutable
            record that proves it. It's three planes around one trust fabric: input governance
            (Vaultex), runtime monitoring and safety (AgentGuard · FIN-SAFE), and a governance engine
            with versioned policies, an append-only audit chain, and regulator-ready evidence packs.
          </p>

          <p style={{ marginTop: "20px", fontSize: "1.02rem", lineHeight: 1.8, color: "var(--ink-soft)" }}>
            We build it open-core because trust infrastructure earns adoption by being inspectable.
            The interfaces and reference implementations are Apache-2.0 and run standalone forever;
            the tuned detection, BFSI risk taxonomy, and managed compliance are the commercial core.
